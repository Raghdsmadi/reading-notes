## Forms 
An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page,
which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server.
Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, 
including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on.
Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, 
as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.
