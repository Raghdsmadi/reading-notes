## Creating Python Inner Functions
A function defined inside another function is known as an inner function or a nested function. 
In Python, this kind of function can access names in the enclosing function.
- ***Example***
```
 def outer_func():
       def inner_func():
         print("Hello, World!")
          inner_func()


 outer_func()
```

*************************************************************
## Providing Encapsulation
A common use case of inner functions arises when you need to protect, or hide, a given function from everything happening outside of it so that the function is totally hidden from the global scope. 
This kind of behavior is commonly known as encapsulation.


## Building Helper Inner Functions
Sometimes you have a function that performs the same chunk of code in several places within its body.


## Retaining State in a Closure
A closure causes the inner function to retain the state of its environment when called. The closure isnâ€™t the inner function itself but the inner function along with its enclosing environment. 
The closure captures the local variables and name in the containing function and keeps them around.
 - ***Example:***
```

def generate_power(exponent):
    def power(base):
        return base ** exponent
    return power
```

## Modifying the Closure State
Normally, closure variables are completely hidden from the outside world. However, you can provide getter and setter inner functions for them

## Adding Behavior With Inner Functions: Decorators
Python decorators are another popular and convenient use case for inner functions, especially for closures.
Decorators are higher-order functions that take a callable (function, method, class) as an argument and return another callable.

- ***Example*** 
```
@decorator
def decorated_func():
    # Function body...
    pass
```
