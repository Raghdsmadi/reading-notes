## What is Serverless?
Serverless is a cloud application development and execution model that lets developers build and run code without managing servers,
and without paying for idle cloud infrastructure.

********************************************
## Serverless does not mean 'no servers'
The name notwithstanding, there are most definitely servers in serverless computing. 
'Serverless' describes the developer’s experience with those servers—they are are invisible to the developer, who doesn't see them, manage them,
or interact with them in any way.
***********************************************
## just FaaS
Function-as-a-service, or FaaS, is a cloud computing service that enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests, without specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run to code.

- Serverless databases and storage
- Event streaming and messaging
- API gateways
***********************************************
## Serverless vs. PaaS, containers, and VMs

- Provisioning time
- Administrative burden
- Maintenance
- Scaling
- Capacity planning
- Statelessness
- High availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR)
- Resource utilization
- Billing granularity and savings

*****************************************************
Pros:
- Improved developer productivity
- Pay for execution only
- Develop in any language
- Streamlined development/DevOps cycles
- Cost-effective performance
- Usage visibility

*************************************************
Cons:
- Unacceptable latency for certain applications
- Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads
- Monitoring and debugging issues
- Vendor lock-in
