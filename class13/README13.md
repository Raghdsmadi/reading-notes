## Regression
The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.

In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.

****************************************************************
## Linear Regression

Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.

This line can be used to predict future values.

*************************************************
## How Does it Work?
Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of linear regression. We will show you how to use these methods instead of going through the mathematic formula.

In the example below, the x-axis represents age, and the y-axis represents speed. We have registered the age and speed of 13 cars as they were passing a tollbooth. Let us see if the data we collected could be used in a linear regression:

- ***Example*** :
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()
```

*************************************************************************
## R for Relationship
It is important to know how the relationship between the values of the x-axis and the values of the y-axis is, if there are no relationship the linear regression can not be used to predict anything.

This relationship - the coefficient of correlation - is called r.

The r value ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 (and -1) means 100% related.

Python and the Scipy module will compute this value for you, all you have to do is feed it with the x and y values.

****************************************************************************
## Predict Future Values
Now we can use the information we have gathered to predict future values.

Example: Let us try to predict the speed of a 10 years old car.

To do so, we need the same myfunc() function from the example above:
- ***Example*** 
```
from scipy import stats

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)

def myfunc(x):
  return slope * x + intercept

speed = myfunc(10)

print(speed)
```
output :
```
85.59308314937454
```
