---------------------------

Whiteboard-style interviews are ubiquitous in the tech industry.
For those who not had the pleasure, 
whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview. This kind of environment can feel like a pressure cooker and cause even the most competent engineer to fall apart.
********************* 

## Important things for techincal interviews :
1. **Communicate** :The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! 

2. **Restate the Question** :Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. 

3. **Ask About Edge Cases**:It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.

4. **Ask About Test Cases**:This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

5. **Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense**:let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.

6. **Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good**:You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. 

7. **Stuck? Ask for Help** : If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.

# We’re All Human
Above all, remember that we’re all human. Your interviewer has been in your position and understands the stress of a technical interview. Your interviewer has probably seen quite a few candidates sweating it out, but possibly very few open who openly discuss problems in a conversational manner. If you can achieve this, you’ll be in great shape.
